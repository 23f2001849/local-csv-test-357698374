# Project Overview
The project is a single-page web application, developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5. The main objective of this application is to read data from a CSV file named 'products.csv', calculate the total price of all products listed in the file, and display the result in a div with the ID 'total'. The CSV file contains two columns, 'product' and 'price'. The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, providing a clear and concise display of the total price.

# Requirements
The requirements for this project are quite straightforward. The application must be able to accurately read and parse data from a CSV file, and calculate the total price based on the 'price' column. It should be able to handle any potential errors during the data fetching and parsing process, such as network issues or invalid data format. The total price should be displayed in a div with the ID 'total'. The application should also be responsive, meaning that it should display correctly on various screen sizes.

# Installation & Setup
To install and setup this project, follow the steps below:

1. Create a new directory on your local machine and navigate into it using the command line.
2. Create a new HTML file named 'index.html' and copy the provided HTML code into this file.
3. Download the 'products.csv' file and place it in the same directory.
4. Open the 'index.html' file in your preferred web browser to view and interact with the application.

Please note that this application uses Bootstrap 5 for styling, which is loaded from a CDN. Therefore, an active internet connection is required to correctly display the styles.

# Usage Instructions
Once you've opened the 'index.html' file in your web browser, the application will automatically fetch data from the 'products.csv' file and calculate the total price. The total price is then displayed in a large box in the middle of the page. If any errors occur during this process, they will be logged in the browser's console.

# Technical Details
The application is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5. The JavaScript code fetches data from the 'products.csv' file using the Fetch API, and then parses the data using basic string manipulation methods. The total price is calculated by iterating over each line of data, extracting the price, converting it to a number, and adding it to a running total. This total is then displayed in the 'total' div.

# Troubleshooting
If the total price is not displayed, first check your internet connection, as an active connection is required to load Bootstrap 5 from the CDN. Next, check the browser's console for any error messages. If the error message indicates a problem with fetching the CSV file, ensure that the file is located in the same directory as the 'index.html' file and that its name is 'products.csv'. If the error message indicates a problem with parsing the data, ensure that the CSV file is correctly formatted.
